This directory contains all the Scale and Python examples for chapter 2. 

To run Scala code for this chapter use:

* spark-submit --class main.scala.chapter2.MnMcount jars/main-scala-chapter2_2.11-1.0.jar <args>


The equivalent code for Scala is in the scala directory, along instructions how to build jar
