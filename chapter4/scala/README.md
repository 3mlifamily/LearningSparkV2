### How to build the package
 1. sbt clean package
 2. mkdir jars
 3. cp main-scala-chapter4_2.12-1.0.jar from the target/ directory into the jars/

### How to run the example
To run Scala code for this chapter use:

 * `spark-submit --class main.scala.chapter8.8_3_MapAndMapPartition jars/main-scala-chapter8_2.12-1.0.jar`

The equivalent code for Python is in the python directory, along instructions how to run it.
