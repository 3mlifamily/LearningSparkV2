This directory contains all the Scale and Python examples for chapter 6. 

To build the package run `sbt clean package`
To run Scala code for this chapter use:

* `spark-submit --class main.java.chapter6.Example6_3 target/scala-2.11/main-java-chapter6_2.11-1.0.jar`


The equivalent code for Scala is in the scala directory, along instructions how to build jar

Have Fun
Cheers!
