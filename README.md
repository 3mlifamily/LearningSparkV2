# Learning Spark 2nd Edition
GitHub repo for the "Learning Spark 2nd Edition" code examples and notebooks.

You can build all the JAR files for each chapter by running the Python script:
`python build_jars.py`


If you are using Databricks to run the code examples, you can import a .dbc file containing all of the notebooks (not the stand-alone apps) from the [notebooks](notebooks) folder. To sign up for a free Databricks Community Edition account, go to www.databricks.com/try-databricks.
