# Learning Spark 2nd Edition

Welcome to the GitHub repo for Learning Spark 2nd Edition.

Chapters [2](chapter2/README.md), [3](chapter3/README.md), [4](chapter4/README.md), [6](chapter6/README.md), and [7](chapter7/README.md) contain stand-alone Spark applications. You can build all the JAR files for each chapter by running the Python script: `python build_jars.py`.

For all the other chapters, we have provided notebooks in the [notebooks](notebooks) folder. 

Have Fun, Cheers!
